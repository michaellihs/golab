## golab merge-requests ls

List merge requests

### Synopsis


Get all merge requests the authenticated user has access to. By default it returns only merge requests created by the current user. To get all merge requests, use parameter scope=all.

The state parameter can be used to get only merge requests with a given state (opened, closed, or merged) or all of them (all). The pagination parameters page and per_page can be used to restrict the list of merge requests.

Note: the changes_count value in the response is a string, not an integer. This is because when an MR has too many changes to display and store, it will be capped at 1,000. In that case, the API will return the string "1000+" for the changes count.
